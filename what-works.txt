Implemented
===========

Hardware

68040 CPU + Interrupt redirection.
The bottom 4Mb of SRAM
Flash memory at the top of memory

Gavin
=====
Reading from the Mau Keyboard Queue
Reading the RTC (but it is not writeable, it always shows current time)
The five timers and their enable bits, resolution is only one frame.
Interrupt handling but only the MAU Keyboard and SOF interrupt actually fire.
The PS/2 only is sufficiently implemented to convince the MCP there is no keyboard

Seperate displays for 3A/3B F3 toggles between them.
Vicky3A : 800x600 or 1024x768 resolution
Vicky3B : 640x480 or 800x600 resolution (640x400 is not supported)
Pixel Doubling (e.g. resolution halving)

Text
